### Randomized neural networks for preference learning with physiological data

### Abstract
>The paper discusses the use of randomized neural networks to learn a complete ordering between samples of heart-rate variability data by relying solely on par- tial and subject-dependent information concerning pairwise relations between samples. We confront two approaches, i.e. Extreme Learning Machines and Echo State Networks, assessing the eâ†µectiveness in exploiting hand-engineered heart-rate variability features versus using raw beat-to-beat sequential data. Additionally, we introduce a weight sharing architecture and a preference learn- ing error function whose performance is compared with a standard architecture realizing pairwise ranking as a binary-classification task. The models are evalu- ated on real-world data from a mobile application realizing a guided breathing exercises, using a dataset of over 54K exercising sessions. Results show how a randomized neural model processing information in its raw sequential form can outperform its vectorial counterpart, increasing accuracy in predicting the correct sample ordering by about 20%. Further, the experiments highlight the importance of using weight sharing architectures to learn smooth and general- izable complete orders induced by the preference relation.

### How to

Once place dthe expected data in `data/` (see [data readme](data/README.md) )
just ran the script you're interested in, check the supported flags on top of the python file. For example `python esn.py --action=select --prefix=esn_test1`

Note: all the code had been ran using Tensorflow 1.0
